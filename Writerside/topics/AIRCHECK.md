# Artificial Intelligence Ready CHEmiCal Knowledge-base

## Overview
The **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **R**eady **CHE**mi**C**al **K**nowledge-base, or **AIRCHECK** is a project to make
a large, publicly accessible database of chemical activity data. Specifically, AIRCHECK is a collection of datasets 
generated from large DNA-encoded library (DEL) screenings of various protein targets.

The goal of AIRCHECK is to provide both the academic and industry communities with large values of quality chemical
activity data to help with the development of artificial intelligence assisted methods for chemical data. AIRCHECK is
support by the [Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)](https://www.thesgc.org/) in collaboration with [X-Chem](https://www.x-chemrx.com/) and
[HitGen](https://www.hitgen.com/en). 

## Getting Started
If you are new machine learning with chemical data or unfamiliar with DNA-encoded libraries, [this page](DEL.md)
provides a quick, high level overview and some follow-up references to introduce you the core concepts needed to utilize 
the data provided by AIRCHECK
