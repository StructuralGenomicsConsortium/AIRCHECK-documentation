# Artificial Intelligence Ready CHEmiCal Knowledge-base

## Overview
The **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **R**eady **CHE**mi**C**al **K**nowledge-base (**AIRCHECK**) is an open platform developed to share
large-scale, publicly accessible chemical activity data. Specifically, AIRCHECK is a collection of datasets 
generated from large DNA-encoded library (DEL) screenings of various protein targets.

The goal of AIRCHECK is to provide both the academic and industry communities with large, well-annotated chemical
activity data to help with the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for hit discovery. AIRCHECK is
supported by the [Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)](https://www.thesgc.org/) in collaboration with [X-Chem](https://www.x-chemrx.com/) and
[HitGen](https://www.hitgen.com/en). 

## Getting Started
If you are new to machine learning with chemical data or unfamiliar with DNA-encoded libraries, [this page](DEL.md)
provides a quick, high-level overview and some follow-up references to introduce you to the core concepts needed to utilize 
the data provided by AIRCHECK.
